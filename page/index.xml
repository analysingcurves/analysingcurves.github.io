      <description>Dr Márton Sóskuthy is a lecturer in phonetics and phonology in the Department of Language and Linguistic Science at the University of York. His main interests are sound change, phonetics and phonology, and their interactions. He uses computational simulations and statistical modelling to approach questions in these areas.

      <description>This training workshop will focus on two statistical methods for analysing dynamic data: Generalised Additive Mixed Modelling (GAMM) and Functional Data Analysis (FDA). These techniques provide more comprehensive ways of data modelling in comparison to some traditional methods, e.g. linear regression. This is a very welcome development for experimental linguists and psychologists, who typically work with non-linear signals, such as the output of acoustic analysis, tongue movement trajectories, electroencephalography data, or eye movement trajectories.</description>

      <description>Who can apply We welcome researchers in Linguistics and Psychology. PhD students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to attend. Students and unaffiliated researchers will benefit from a reduced registration fee.
The workshop will require some degree of background in R and statistical analysis. Experience with linear mixed effects regression would be beneficial for the GAMM part, while general knowledge of Principal Component Analysis and basic calculus (the concepts of derivative and of definite integral) would be beneficial (but not essential) for the FDA part.</description>
